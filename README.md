# Git_Tools
A collection of git administration tools I wrote to help automate managing my git repos

## What do they all do?
Funny you ask!

1. **Git_Mngr.sh**: This script will clone repos and update existing repos for you.
2. **Git_Links.sh**: This script will go thru folders and tries to pull down the git repo link. 
3. **GitCleaners.sh**: This script was something I made to clean up a mistake I made.
4. **GitHTMLParser.sh**: This script will go through an HTML file and pull out git repo links.
5. **Git_Roleback.sh**: This script will force reset a git commit, good for troubleshooting merge collisions.
6. **Git_UPdater.sh**: This script will update your existing repo, I wrote this purely out of laziness lol.
